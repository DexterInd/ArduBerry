## Getting Started

We've devoted some serious time to trying to make sure that it's easy to get started.  If you're lost, we would like to first direct you to our [website for the Arduberry] (http://www.dexterindustries.com/Arduberry/)


## This Repository

This repository only holds firmware and hardware designs.

## Image for the SD Card
Our custom image for the Raspberry Pi makes using the Arduberry easy.  We've modified wheezy a little bit.  You can download the latest image here:

## Firmware
The board firmware is made in Arduino in order to make it super-hackable.  The firmware is written in Arduino 1.0 and can be uploaded via an ISP programmer.  It can also be uploaded with an Arduino Uno, with an adapter explained in this repository.

The board supports LEGO NXT motors and LEGO NXT sensors, as well as many of Dexter Industries sensors for LEGO Mindstorms.
